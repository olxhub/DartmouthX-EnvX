Even when we are sleeping, many people are consuming energy from heating/cooling their room, charging their electronics, or failing to contemplate the energy required in order to make the pillow we are sleeping on. </span></p>

Conservation is the practice of reducing one&rsquo;s energy use through behavioral changes among energy consumers. This can include turning off lights in an empty room or walking to a friend&rsquo;s house instead of driving. Efficiency on the other hand deals with maximizing or optimizing energy, in order to consume less energy while sufficing the energy requirement. Efficiency includes installing more efficient light bulbs like LEDs, or buying a car that has a high miles per gallon. Together, individuals can take conservation and efficient measures in order to reduce primary energy use, and therefore reducing the environmental negative externalities from energy production, transport and combustion.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
