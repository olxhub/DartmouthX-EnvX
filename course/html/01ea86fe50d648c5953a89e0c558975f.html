<p class="p1">Dear ENVX Class Member,</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;Renewable Energy&rdquo; (Week 5) is now available. The week begins with highlights of some of your &ldquo;energy that flows through your fingertips&rdquo; discussion posts. They were great and some of the threads have 10-30 replies. This week, we explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is renewable energy?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How do we evaluate hydro, solar, wind and biomass from an environmental science perspective?</li>
<li>How can we increase efficiency and conservation?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We take a field trip to a PV tracker solar system, visit a straw bale house and have a conversation about waste vegetable oil as an energy source in India.&nbsp; Keep up the great work. &nbsp;</p>
