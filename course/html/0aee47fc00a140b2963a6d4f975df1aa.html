<h1>Age-structure Diagrams</h1>
<p>Age-structure diagrams are a valuable tool when studying populations. Here we show age-structure diagrams for the United States from two points in the past and one point in the future. Population in millions is shown along the x axis (horizontal) with males to the left in blue and females to the right in red. The y axis (vertical) shows age intervals.&nbsp;</p>
