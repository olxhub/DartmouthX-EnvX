<p class="p1">Dear ENVX Class Member,</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;The Human Population&rdquo; (Week 2) is now available.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">This week begins&nbsp;with a video recap of some of your discussion posts and highlights from Week 1 and then a transition to Week 2. <br />We explore questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people live on Earth right now?</li>
<li>What is the carrying capacity of Earth?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the number of people, where they live, the resources they consume and their environmental impact?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Finally we bring you a conversation with Phil Connors, an Australian Environmental Scientist, about human population and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Keep up the great work in the discussion forums, quizzes and helping each other out with questions. &nbsp;To access Week 2, <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/DartmouthX/DART.ENVS.01.X/2015_T1/courseware/15bbc2cd07504a6d8690b6bc92d41e33/7a77eac265fc4b9ab295895039000819/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
