<h2>CONSERVATION OF ENERGY</h2>
<p id="id3241902" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px 0px; color: #555555;">Though energy can be converted from one form to another, energy cannot be created or destroyed. This principle is called the "law of conservation of energy" or the <strong>1st Law of Thermodynamics</strong>. For example, in a motorcycle, the chemical potential energy of the fuel changes to kinetic energy. In a radio, electricity is converted into kinetic energy and wave energy (sound).</p>

Though ideal machines conserve the mechanical energy of a system, some of the energy always turns into heat when using a machine. For example, heat generated by friction is hard to collect and transform into another form of energy. In this situation, heat energy is usually considered unusable or lost.</p>
