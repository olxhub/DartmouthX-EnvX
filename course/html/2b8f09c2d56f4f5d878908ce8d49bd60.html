<h1>The Human Population</h1>
<h2>Carrying Capacity</h2>
<p>The human carrying capacity is a concept explored by many people, most famously Thomas Robert Malthus (1766 - 1834). <span data-type="term">Carrying capacity, "K,"</span> refers to the number of individuals of a population that can be sustained indefinitely by a given area. At carrying capacity, the population will have an impact on the resources of the given area, but not to the point where the area can no longer sustain the population. Just as a population of wildebeest or algae has a carrying capacity, so does a human population.</p>

<p id="id5011361">Humans, while subject to the same ecological constraints as any other species (a need for nutrients, water and other resources), have some features as individuals and some as a population that make them a unique species. Unlike most other organisms, humans have the capacity to alter their number of offspring, level of resource consumption and distribution. While most women around the world could potentially have the same number of children during their lives, the number they actually have is affected by many factors. Depending upon technological, cultural, economic and educational factors, people around the world have families of different sizes. Additionally, unlike other organisms, humans invent and alter technology, which allows them to change their environment. This ability makes it difficult to determine the human &nbsp;c<span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">arrying capacity</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">.</span></p>
<h2 data-type="title">Malthusian Theory</h2>

<p>Thomas Malthus (1766&ndash;1834) was an English clergyman who made dire predictions about Earth&rsquo;s ability to sustain its growing population. According to <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1681153">Malthusian theory</span>, three factors would control human population that exceeded the earth&rsquo;s <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1302004">carrying capacity</span>, or how many people can live in a given area considering the amount of available resources. He identified these factors as war, famine, and disease (Malthus 1798). He termed these &ldquo;positive checks&rdquo; because they increased mortality rates, thus keeping the population in check, so to speak. These are countered by &ldquo;preventative checks,&rdquo; which also seek to control the population, but by reducing fertility rates; preventive checks include birth control and celibacy. Thinking practically, Malthus saw that people could only produce so much food in a given year, yet the population was increasing at an exponential rate. Eventually, he thought people would run out of food and begin to starve. They would go to war over the increasingly scarce resources, reduce the population to a manageable level, and the cycle would begin anew.</p>

<h2 data-type="title">Zero Population Growth</h2>
<p id="import-auto-id1410462">A neo-Malthusian researcher named Paul Ehrlich brought Malthus&rsquo;s predictions into the 20th century. However, according to Ehrlich, it is the environment, not specifically the food supply, that will play a crucial role in the continued health of planet&rsquo;s population (Ehrlich 1968). His ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse, as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources, such as water and air. He advocated for a goal of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1304304">zero population growth</span> (ZPG), in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration. While support for this concept is mixed, it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation.</p>

<h2 data-type="title">Cornucopian Theory</h2>
<p id="import-auto-id1252417">Of course, some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world&rsquo;s population will meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1202913">Cornucopian theory</span> scoffs at the idea of humans wiping themselves out; it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues that develop. As an example, it points to the issue of food supply. If we need more food, the theory contends, agricultural scientists will figure out how to grow it, as they have already been doing for centuries. After all, in this perspective, human ingenuity has been up to the task for thousands of years and there is no reason for that pattern not to continue (Simon 1981).</p>
<p>As you can see, there are a variety of opinions and perspectives on human carrying capacity on earth.</p>
