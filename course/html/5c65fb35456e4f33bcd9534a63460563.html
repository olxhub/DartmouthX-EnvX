<p>Didymo (<em>Didymosphenia geminata</em>), also known as "rock snot," is a type of algae that forms thick, slimey, mat-like growths (blooms) on the bottom of stream beds. These blooms can harm the stream ecosystem by reducing stream biodiversity, choking out the organisms that live on the stream bottom, and affecting the fish that rely on those organisms as a source of food. Didymo blooms can also deplete the oxygen in the stream, killing off fish and crustaceans. Additionally, the gooey mats reduce the appeal of streams and rivers for human recreational use. Once didymo infests a stream or river, there is little people can do to control or eradicate it.</p>
<p>Didymo was discovered in Canada in 1988, but did not receive significant attention until the 2000s when it began appearing in the southern United States, and later in Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Believing it was an invasive species, governments and scientists promoted rules for cleaning boats and other water equipment to try and stop the spread of the algae. However, scientists have recently discovered fossilized forms of didymo in various countries across Europe, Asia, and North and South America, indicating that didymo is not, in fact, an invasive species. So why is it blooming in so many places today?</p>
<p>Recent environmental changes may be the cause. Unlike many algal species, didymo thrives most in low phosphorus environments. With &nbsp;increased global temperatures due to climate change, the timing of seasons and snowfall patterns have changed, reducing phosphorus inputs into rivers and streams. This story of didymo illustrates some of the challenges environmental scientists face when trying to understand how the natural world works, and how humans may be influencing it.</p>
