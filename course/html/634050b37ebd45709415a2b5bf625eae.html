<p>We have just taken a tour of a powerplant that converts the <strong>potential energy</strong>&nbsp;of a quantity of oil to <strong>kinetic energy</strong> in steam that turns a turbine that turns a generator, resulting in the production of electrical energy. In addition, the same power plant supplies steam to the Dartmouth campus for heating buildings and water.&nbsp;</p>
