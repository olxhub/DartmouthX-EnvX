<h1>The Cycling of Matter</h1>
<p id="id1169996747585" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px 0px; color: #555555;">If people are to live sustainably, they need to understand the processes that control the availability and stability of the ecosystem services on which their well-being depends. Chief among these processes are the&nbsp;<span data-type="term" style="box-sizing: border-box;">biogeochemical cycles</span>&nbsp;that describe <span data-effect="bold" style="box-sizing: border-box;"></span>how chemical elements (e.g. nitrogen, carbon) or molecules (e.g. water) are transformed and stored by both the physical and biological&nbsp;components of the earth system. Storage occurs in&nbsp;<span data-type="term" style="box-sizing: border-box;">pools</span>, which are amounts of material that share some common characteristic and are relatively uniform in nature, e.g. the pool of carbon found as carbon dioxide (CO<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 11px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; bottom: -0.25em;">2</span>) in the atmosphere. Transformations or flows of materials from one pool to another in the cycle are described as&nbsp;<span data-type="term" style="box-sizing: border-box;">fluxes</span>; for example, the movement of water from the soil to the atmosphere resulting from evaporation is a flux.&nbsp;<span data-type="term" style="box-sizing: border-box;">Physical components of the earth system</span>&nbsp;are nonliving factors such as rocks, minerals, water, climate, air and energy.&nbsp;<span data-type="term" style="box-sizing: border-box;">Biological components of the earth system</span>&nbsp;include all living organisms, e.g. plants, animals and microbes. Both the physical and biological components of the earth system have varied over geological time. Some landmark changes include the colonization of the land by plants (~400 million years ago), the evolution of mammals (~200 million years ago), the evolution of modern humans (~200 thousand years ago) and the end of the last ice age (~10 thousand years ago). The earth system and its biogeochemical cycles were relatively stable from the end of the last ice age until the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries initiated a significant and ongoing rise in human population and activity. Today, anthropogenic (human) activities are altering all major ecosystems and the biogeochemical cycles they drive. Many chemical elements and molecules are critical to life on Earth, but the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, water and nitrogen are most critical to human well-being and the natural world.</p>
