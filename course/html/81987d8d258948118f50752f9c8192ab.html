<h2>Prompted Discussion</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Last week, we learned that energy that "flows through your fingertips" refers to energy that you control directly such as the energy you use when you turn on a light switch, adjust a thermostat, operate a car, use public transportation, or eat food.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This week, we will expand on this idea and ask you to post about a renewable energy source that &ldquo;flows through your fingertips.&rdquo; Perhaps your city or country has a large wind farm. Or maybe you own a renewable energy system such as PV panels.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, a search for &ldquo;New Hampshire electricity fuel mix&rdquo; returns <a href="http://www.nh.gov/oep/energy/energy-nh/" target="_blank">this website</a>&nbsp;and the following chart:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><i><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><img src="/static/NH_fuel_mix.jpeg" alt="New Hampshire fuel mix pie chart" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" width="280" height="215" /></span></i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New Hampshire obtains approximately 14% of its electricity from renewable sources (6% hydro + 8% biomass).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prompted Discussion Assignment</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write a post that presents the <strong>renewable</strong> energy that "flows through your fingertips.&rdquo; Include the following information:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">The country you live in (and if it is a large country, what region).</span></li>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul>
<li>One renewable energy source that &ldquo;flows through your fingertips.&rdquo; We recommend you choose electricity and search on the web to find information about the "fuel mix" for your community, region or country&nbsp;(see the New Hampshire example above).&nbsp;</li>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul>
<li>The&nbsp;percentage of your electricity, if any, that comes from renewable sources. Also include the breakdown of renewables by source (hydro, wind, solar and biomass).</li>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul>
<li><strong>Or</strong> if you know of other renewable sources that &ldquo;flow through your fingertips,&rdquo; report on those. For example, you might determine the fraction of your diesel fuel usage that is biodiesel.&nbsp;</li>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul>
<li><strong>Optional:</strong>&nbsp;Consider posting a photo of a&nbsp;renewable energy source in your community.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Finally, ask an environmental science question related to someone else's post about their renewable energy use.</span></p>
