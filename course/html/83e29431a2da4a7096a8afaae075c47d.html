<h1 class="p1">What is environmental science?</h1>
<p class="p1"><b>Environmental science</b> is the study of the natural world and how it is influenced by, and influences, people.&nbsp; Environmental science is a subset of the broader field of <b>environmental studies</b>, which covers the natural sciences, social sciences and literary and non-fiction writings as well as ethics and philosophy of the interactions of people with the natural world. For our purposes, we will define environment as all of the living and non-living conditions that surround us and influence life.</p>
<p class="p1">Environmental studies in the United States is an interdisciplinary academic field that grew out of a social movement&mdash;the concern among people about the state of the natural world that occurred in the late 1960s and culminated in Earth Day 1970, a nationwide event to call attention to the plight of the environment. Environmental studies is sometimes referred to as a problem-based area of study. It is often &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; and involves practice-based learning.</p>
<p>Since Earth Day 1970, numerous environmental studies departments and programs in the United States have been established at universities and colleges around the United States. While their missions vary, most are interested in the scholarly examination of how people interact with the natural world. In the last decade, the related field of <b>sustainability</b> or sustainability science has become more prominent. Sustainability is commonly defined as carrying out a set of resource-use practices today that does not jeopardize the ability of future generations to use those resources, or have a similar standard of living.</p>
