<h2>Prompted Discussion</h2>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">In previous Prompted Discussions you wrote about your personal environmental impact, including Week 3, Your Favorite Meal and in Weeks 4 and 5, Energy That Flows Through Your Fingertips.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">This&nbsp;week we ask, what&rsquo;s missing? What other areas of your life would you evaluate from an environmental impact perspective?</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">You could consider your use of another energy supply, or water, or land or many other resources.</p>
<h2>Prompted Discussion Assignment</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write a post that presents one other area that you wish to evaluate.&nbsp;Include the following information:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">The country you live in (and if it is a large country, what region).</span></li>
<li>Which resource did you choose to evaluate?&nbsp;</li>
<li><em><span style="font-style: normal; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">What measures and units would you use to assess this resource use and your resulting impact?</span></em></li>
<li>Consider posting a figure or&nbsp;diagram that illustrates your evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Finally, ask an environmental science question related to someone else's post about their evaluation.</span></p>
