<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear ENVX Class Member,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final week of ENVX, &ldquo;Global Change&rdquo; (Week 6), is now available. We explore:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>What is global change and how is it influenced by population numbers, and food and energy choices?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What are some of the effects of global change on humans and natural ecosystems?</li>
<li>What are additional factors in evaluating personal environmental impact?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of you have been with us for the past five weeks and some of you are just starting the course now. Either way, you have until <b>March 20th</b> to finish all work. Certificates and Verified Certificates will be issued by March 31st.</span></p>
