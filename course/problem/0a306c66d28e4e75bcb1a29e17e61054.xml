      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that when energy is transformed its ability to do work decreases and randomness increases (entropy). “The total quantity of energy in the system remains constant” is true, but is stated in the 1st Law of Thermodynamics. “Over time a system will spontaneously become more ordered” is the opposite of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and untrue. </p>
