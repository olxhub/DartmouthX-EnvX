      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Burning fossil fuels can release compounds present in the material and as they combine with oxygen, can create air pollutants. Coal has the highest percentage of sulfur compared to oil (which has some) and natural gas (which has a negligible amount). The use of nuclear fuels does not involve the release of sulfur.
