<p>Explanation</p>
<p>Humans impact the nitrogen cycle as a result of all of these activities.</p>

<p>Creating wetlands promotes denitrification which releases nitrous oxide. Any combustion in the atmosphere (such as of coal or natural gas) results in the formation of nitrogen oxide. Adding fertilizers, which typically contain nitrogen, to agricultural land, which results in runoff which can make its way to nearby bodies of water. </p>
