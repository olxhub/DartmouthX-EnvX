Combustion releases carbon primarily in the form of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and often occurs as the burning of fossil fuels. Photosynthesis occurs within plant cells, such as those on the leaves of trees and takes up this carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Respiration, occurring in all living cells, including plant cells, results in the release of carbon dioxide. Exchange occurs at the ocean surface. Sedimentation is the burial of sediments and debris, often deep under the surface of the ocean.
