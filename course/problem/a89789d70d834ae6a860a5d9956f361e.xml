    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Growth rate is calculated through the following equation:</p>
      <p>Growth equals (Births + Immigration - Deaths - Emigration)/Total Population</p>
      <p>Therefore, the growth rate of this village equals (50 + 40 - 40 - 0 (no emigration))/500 which equals 0.10, or 10%</p>
