      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The melting of an ice sheet, which exposes a darker surface leading to increased heat absorption, would be a positive feedback loop, as the system is moving further from its original state, and the increased heat absorption would make the ice sheet melt faster. </p>
      <p>The thermostat turning on the heater in a cooling house would be an example of a negative feedback loop, as the house is moving towards its original temperature (state). </p>
      <p>An increase in temperature leads to cloud formation, which blocks sunlight, and moves the system towards its original state. Therefore, it is a negative feedback system.</p>
