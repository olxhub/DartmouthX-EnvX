<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>The burning or combustion of fossil fuels (fossilized carbon), which has increased greatly over the last century, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The net destruction of vegetation has also played a role, as the vegetation is no longer there to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.</p>
