    "you know the advantages as much as possible number one in the issues that I", 
    "find", 
    "arm challenging is every time you convert energy from one form to another", 
    "you get losses that's what the second law of thermodynamics", 
    "Chelsea and so the most simple way to keep this room", 
    "would be to have a little fire pit right here in the middle of the room", 
    "and have a fire and have a little ventilation system and", 
    "convert the potential energy and carbon bonds at the word",

    "that Van are going through spy tapes",

    "heating water", 
    "so how do you reconcile those principles in their second law", 
    "with the fact that there's convenience and as you mentioned earlier", 
    "by having a central plant you've got one place where you can do all your", 
    "pollution control you make all your decisions you have", 
    "a highly skilled team in there in years monitoring the burn as opposed to having", 
    "a hundred different oil burners all around campus ahead anyway those things", 
    "and heading", 
    "communicate that to say undergraduate student or anybody else", 
    "yet was a great it's a great point and I think I think about human energy as part", 
    "of the equation", 
    "and so to me the human energy of having thing centralized is", 
    "the reduction in human energy as opposed to having", 
    "100 people whose job it is to 10 the coal fire in 100 individual classrooms", 
    "that efficiency factors into the equation for me", 
    "so well you're experiencing line or losses throughout the system of", 
    "conversion from", 
    "currently a liquid fuel oil into steam", 
    "into the pipes to keep the buildings we also are we've added human efficiency", 
    "and to some extent organizational efficiency I think about this a lot", 
    "because I think many other challenges that we have", 
    "operationally have nothing to do with operations they often have to do with", 
    "human systems organizational systems that are decision-making bodies", 
    "an example a turban is we knew we've known for years that", 
    "it would be more efficient if we switch to natural gas for example from a", 
    "financial perspective", 
    "and potentially from an energy perspective and certainly from a", 
    "greenhouse gas emissions and remind us why from a greenhouse gas perspective", 
    "because natural gas is cleaner burning so will experience about a 28 percent", 
    "emissions reduction if we burn natural gas as opposed to number six YHL", 
    "meaning it puts out less co2 car unit correct", 
    "energy and he correct so it's more efficient on a greenhouse gas emissions", 
    "perspective", 
    "per BTU have have energy produced a few produced", 
    "and so we've known that for three years but in the time", 
    "that we've known that and natural gas prices have remained low during that", 
    "time", 
    "we've had some transitions in our senior leadership which had made it impossible", 
    "to decide to switch to natural gas", 
    "so there's an example where we know what a more efficient", 
    "route is but the organizational structure makes it such that we have to", 
    "wait until", 
    "to decision-making structures in place", 
    "to make that change so so that's kinda at the most macro level but may bring it", 
    "into more micro level", 
    "one other things the again that I think about is just the human efficiency and", 
    "having a centralized plant were deliveries are centralized", 
    "there's only you know there's one truck going to one place while in our case is", 
    "more than one truck going to one place", 
    "on and filling up one tank as opposed to you were two tanks William yeah i text", 
    "as opposed to individual call deliveries to takes right next to each entry", 
    "connected by pain", 
    "so and but when you had individual call deliveries every day there was a coal", 
    "truck coming to every house", 
    "right now a different way to think about that and this is where it gets a little", 
    "disorganized and complicated", 
    "is each of those coal trucks was driven by person who had a job", 
    "so in some ways as inefficiencies supported our economy", 
    "but in some ways the human efficiencies have the plant factor in", 
    "know there's assertive what second one third thermodynamics on people to", 
    "and on human energy so I think about that is part of the equation", 
    "and well the losses are frustrating they may or may not be paid back by the gains", 
    "in human efficiency and operational efficiency", 
    "having everything centralized and organizational efficiency of having one", 
    "decision makers oppose to", 
    "each building being separate decision maker that answer your question yr does", 
    "that feel like a little bit of a cop out", 
    "no no that's really helpful another thing that comes up later on in our", 
    "course", 
    "is a issues related to climate change", 
    "and a climate action plan so I was wondering if you could tell us what is a", 
    "climate action plan", 
    "and to you are you have you worked on one for Dartmouth NS", 
    "and then what do we use tell people who are thinking about applying", 
    "principles from this course and perhaps choosing to design their own Climate", 
    "Action Plan", 
    "so Climate Action Plan is essentially a road map that tells you how you're gonna", 
    "improve over time to reduce your", 
    "missions in your other environmental impacts that affect climate", 
    "so that's essentially what a Climate Action Plan is and usually that involves", 
    "having a target that you're driving towards", 
    "so Dartmouth has a set emissions targets", 
    "with the end goal over 30 percent emissions reduction by 2030", 
    "in such a 2005 baseline and just two specify were talking about emissions of", 
    "carbon dioxide agreement", 
    "on call backside equivalent so greenhouse gas emissions so methane and", 
    "and other greenhouse gases are bundled into that but for Dartmouth were mostly", 
    "talking about carbon dioxide carbon tax correct", 
    "an so a typical Climate Action Plan for university will have", 
    "Climate Action for Soria greenhouse gas emissions goal and then", 
    "pub probably also some other goals that are related to climate", 
    "and also related to broader sustainability initiatives so they might", 
    "include for example a waste reduction goal", 
    "because waste is indirectly related to methane emissions in landfills", 
    "or I might include a transportation go because transportation is related to the", 
    "emissions at you", 
    "that you met your greenhouse gas emissions on", 
    "so I put together Climate Action Plan at in", 
    "in my prior professional life put together several for other universities", 
    "dermis doesn't have what I would call a formal Climate Action Plan yet", 
    "but that's our task over I would say the next year and a half to come up with the", 
    "formal Climate Action Plan we have lots a piece is a bit but we haven't put", 
    "together a comprehensive plan", 
    "and if you are an individual on but safer fine you wanted to put together", 
    "your own personal", 
    "Climate Action Plan wonder whether the starting point at you because", 
    "about something like that so the first thing to do is to look at your life", 
    "and and look at all the different types in packs you have and then to determine", 
    "whether the tapes have impacts you have that are the largest climate impacts", 
    "so probably for most people that's their home", 
    "and home heating and cooling an it might be transportation depending on what kind", 
    "of Transportation profile you have", 
    "and it might be food and your consumption of food and", 
    "that kinda resource so your your family's consumption", 
    "so I if I were doing a quick Climate Action Plan I think I would look for the", 
    "biggest", 
    "impacts first so I would look at my home and its efficiency", 
    "I would look at transportation and I would look at food and I we do a little", 
    "bit of an audit", 
    "what do we use I would maybe take my power bills whether that's", 
    "electricity or propane or maybe would I burn a lot of wood in my house I have to", 
    "factor that into my Climate Action Plan", 
    "and then I would do an assessment where i stand. how", 
    "based on maybe my emissions from a certain period of time extrapolate or", 
    "develop a proxy for the year and then I would help a goal", 
    "how much do you think I can reduce am a great place to start with your home is", 
    "to do in energy efficiency on it", 
    "and there are lots of incentives to do that then make it cost-effective now", 
    "an and it depends on what state you live in whether those incentives apply to you", 
    "that something that I did I did a blower door test and an efficiency test and", 
    "then I had a check list of all the things I could", 
    "do to improve the efficiency of my home with a direct", 
    "I'm understanding have how those things would impact what it was like to live in", 
    "my home", 
    "many of them may have been my home a lot more comfortable we live in a place", 
    "where there's cold winters and", 
    "having your house more insulated is", 
    "makes a lot more comfortable and so I would start with those big-ticket items", 
    "and I we move through transportation and maybe do a food got it for a week when", 
    "we buy for we take your grocery bills", 
    "and get a rough estimate of what your household eats and then you can go", 
    "online in use", 
    "and have a number of tools to develop a sense of what your carbon impacts are", 
    "based on the electricity consumed the fuels you consume the food you consume", 
    "how you travel and how many miles you travel a multi-vehicle", 
    "and can start to get a proxy for for your own", 
    "emissions and Impax and then set some goals and start to develop a plan on how", 
    "you're gonna get there", 
    "so thank you Rosie very much her talking to us and", 
    "I don't know we might come in ask you have another chat at some time", 
    "that would be great I really enjoyed it"
